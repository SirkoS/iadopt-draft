The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology primarily designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies). One of the challenges in representing semantic descriptions of variables is getting people to agree about what they mean when describing the components that define the variables. The I-ADOPT ontology addresses this by providing core components and their relations that can be applied to define machine-interpretable variable descriptions that re-use FAIR vocabulary terms. The first version of the ontology, developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group satisfied the basic cross-domain interoperability requirements. This second version of the ontology includes exactly the same original components plus an extension which is designed to support the aggregation of variables using a range of user-defined coarser concepts to facilitate dataset  discovery and aggregation into products.
