The I-ADOPT Framework ontology is a simple ontology designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description schemes (including domain-specific ontologies, semantic models, structured controlled vocabularies) and to support further development of machine-readable variable descriptions that re-use components mapped to FAIR vocabulary terms. This first version of the ontology has been developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group.
