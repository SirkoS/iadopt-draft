The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology primarily designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies). One of the challenges in representing semantic descriptions of variables is getting people to agree about what they mean when describing the components that define the variables. The I-ADOPT ontology addresses this by providing core components and their relations that can be applied to define machine-interpretable variable descriptions that re-use FAIR vocabulary terms. It was developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group.

#### Changelog

* The first published versions of the ontology up to v0.9.1 satisfied the basic cross-domain interoperability requirements.
* Version v1.0 of the ontology includes exactly the same original components plus an extension which is designed to support the aggregation of variables using a range of user-defined coarser concepts to facilitate dataset discovery and aggregation into products.
* Version v1.1 introduces the concept of Systems for any entity role, the StatisticalModifier, and allows constraints to constrain any description component.
