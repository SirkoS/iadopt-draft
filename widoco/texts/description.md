The I-ADOPT Framework ontology is a simple ontology designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description schemes (including domain-specific ontologies, semantic models, structured controlled vocabularies) and to support further development of machine-readable variable descriptions that re-use components mapped to FAIR vocabulary terms. This first version of the ontology has been developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group. 
The ontology is made of just four classes (Variable, Property, Entity, Constraint) and six object properties (hasProperty, hasObjectOfInterest, hasContextObject, hasMatrix, hasConstraint, constrains). The Variable is the top concept. It is the description of something observed or mathematically derived. It minimally consists of one entity (the ObjectOfInterest) and its Property; a property being a type of characteristic (i.e. a quantity or a quality). More complex variables can involve additional entities, for example an entity may have the role of Matrix and/or of ContextObject(s). The framework does not include units, measurement methods and geographical location information however usage recommendation will make explicit reference to these by connecting the I-ADOPT framework to existing and complementary ontologies.
